## üöÄ How to Use

Getting started with the Currency Converter & PPP Calculator is straightforward. Choose the method that best suits your needs:

### Method 1: Direct Executable (Recommended for All Users)

This is the simplest and most convenient way to run the application, requiring no technical setup.

1.  Visit the **[Releases](https://github.com/debadyutidey007/Currency_Convertor_And_Purchase_Power_Parity_Calculator/releases)** section on this GitHub repository.
2.  Locate the latest release and download the `main.exe` file.
3.  Save the executable to any preferred location on your computer (e.g., your Desktop or a dedicated applications folder).
4.  **Double-click `main.exe`** to launch the application immediately.

### Method 2: From Source Code (For Developers & Contributors)

If you're a developer, prefer to run the application from its source, or wish to contribute, follow these steps:

1.  **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have **[Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)** installed on your system. Python 3.8 or newer is recommended for optimal compatibility.
2.  **Clone the Repository**: Open your terminal or command prompt and execute the following commands to clone the project:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/debadyutidey007/Currency_Convertor_And_Purchase_Power_Parity_Calculator.git](https://github.com/debadyutidey007/Currency_Convertor_And_Purchase_Power_Parity_Calculator.git)
    cd Currency_Convertor_And_Purchase_Power_Parity_Calculator
    ```
3.  **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (Highly Recommended): Creating a virtual environment isolates project dependencies, preventing conflicts with other Python projects.
    ```bash
    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate

    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
4.  **Install Dependencies**: With your virtual environment activated, install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install customtkinter
    # If the application uses other specific libraries for API calls or data,
    # you might need to add them here, e.g., pip install requests
    ```
5.  **Run the Application**: Finally, execute the main script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## üìà How PPP is Calculated

The Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) calculation is a fundamental economic concept that allows for a more accurate comparison of living standards and purchasing power between different countries, bypassing misleading market exchange rate fluctuations. The application utilizes the following core formula for its PPP analysis:

<p align="center">

$$
\displaystyle
\mathrm{Equivalent\ Cost}
= \mathrm{Amount}_{\mathrm{base}}
\times
\left(
  \frac{\mathrm{PPP\ Index}_{\mathrm{target}}}
       {\mathrm{PPP\ Index}_{\mathrm{base}}}
\right)
$$

</p>

**Explanation:**
* $\textbf{Amount}_{\textbf{base}}$: The original monetary amount in the starting (base) currency.
* $\textbf{PPP Index}_{\textbf{target}}$: The Purchasing Power Parity index for the target country. This index reflects the general price level of a "basket of goods" in that country relative to a reference (often the US dollar or a global average).
* $\textbf{PPP Index}_{\textbf{base}}$: The Purchasing Power Parity index for the base country.

By applying this formula, the calculator estimates the amount in the target currency that would be required to purchase the same "basket of goods and services" as the initial amount in the base currency, thereby offering a more realistic measure of comparative value.
