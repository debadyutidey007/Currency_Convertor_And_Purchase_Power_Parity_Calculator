## üöÄ How to Use

There are two methods to run this application. The first is recommended for most users.

### Method 1: Direct Executable (Recommended)

This is the simplest way to get started.

1.  Navigate to the **[Releases](https://github.com/debadyutidey007/Currency_Convertor_And_Purchase_Power_Parity_Calculator/releases)** section of this repository.
2.  Download the `main.exe` file from the latest release.
3.  Save the file to a convenient location on your computer.
4.  **Double-click `main.exe`** to launch the application instantly.

### Method 2: From Source Code (For Developers)

If you wish to run the application from the source code or contribute to its development:

1.  **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your system.
2.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/debadyutidey007/Currency_Convertor_And_Purchase_Power_Parity_Calculator.git](https://github.com/debadyutidey007/Currency_Convertor_And_Purchase_Power_Parity_Calculator.git)
    cd Currency_Convertor_And_Purchase_Power_Parity_Calculator
    ```
3.  **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (Recommended):
    ```bash
    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate
    
    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
4.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install customtkinter
    ```
5.  **Run the Application**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## üìà How PPP is Calculated

The Purchasing Power Parity calculation provides a more realistic comparison of economic well-being. The formula used is:

$$ \text{Equivalent Cost} = \text{Amount}_{\text{base}} \times \left( \frac{\text{PPP Index}_{\text{target}}}{\text{PPP Index}_{\text{base}}} \right) $$

This helps estimate the amount in the target currency required to buy the same "basket of goods" as the original amount in the base currency.
